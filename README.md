# -Fraud-Detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent online transactions. The goal is to enhance security and minimize financial losses for businesses by identifying suspicious activities in real-time.Data for the case is available in CSV format having 6362620 rows and 10 columns. Candidates can use whatever method they wish to develop their machine learning model.
